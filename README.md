Interior design and creativity come together at SimplifAI. This project gives users a range of tools to create and visualise their ideal living space, from generating custom room images based on user input to building their own 3D rooms complete with walls, windows, and furniture to experiencing their rooms in immersive augmented reality and 360-degree panorama views. We have various features, which include Room Image Generation through Prompt, AR Marketplace, 3D Room Builder, and Room Panorama Effect. The Room Design project offers an impressive collection of tools to help you realise your creative idea, whether you're an interior designer, a homeowner, or just someone who enjoys playing around with different living environments.


This project consists of four main features:

-Room Image Generation through Prompt
 This feature allows users to generate images of rooms based on prompts provided by the user. Users can specify the size of the room, the 
 color scheme, and the style of the furniture. The Room Image Generation feature uses machine learning algorithms to generate realistic images of the room.
-Object detection and price estimation of the cost that would take to replicate the room. 
-Room Panorama Effect
 The Room Panorama Effect feature allows users to view their room in a 360-degree panorama. Users can move their device around to view the 
 room from different angles. This feature uses panoramic image stitching technology to create a seamless panorama of the room.
